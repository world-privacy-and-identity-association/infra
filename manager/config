#to=

# (required) Hostname or IP address of the infra system.
#domain=

## Functions

# Run a command in the infra system, accepting additional ssh-options.
function ssh_target {
    ssh -i vm-key "$to" "$@"
}

# Install nre-files to the target system.
#
# * Extract all "signer-server" to modules/cassiopeia_signer/files in the target system.
# * Extract all "signer-client" to modules/cassiopeia_client/files in the target system.
# * Extract all "gigi" to modules/ner/files in the target system.
function install_nre {
    ./installNRE "$targetHost"
}

# Configure variables for puppet.
#
# The default implementation prompts the user for all required variables.
function configure {
    ssh_target -t 'bash conf-puppet --force'
    ssh_target 'sed -i "s%\$signerLocation = '".*'"'%\$signerLocation = '"'$signerLocation'"'%" environments/production/manifests/ip.pp'
}

# Reset a vm to its base snapshot.
#
# The default implementation asks the user to do so.
function do_reset_vm {
    read -rp "Please reset your VM and confirm by pressing enter." _
}

# Execute the gigi bootstrapping process. By default the process interacts with the user.
#
# This function can be overridden to execute "execute-bootstrap-user-auto" in order to automate this bootstrapping process.
# Make sure to provide "bootstrapper_details" to provide the necessary answers.
# To fully automate bootstrapping, you need to provide a way to extract the activation link (see "read_activation_link").
function execute-bootstrap-user {
    ssh_target -t 'bash bootstrap-user'
}

# Obtain the activation link in the variable "$link".
#
# This is required for activating the first bootstrappers account.
# This is only required for automated bootstrap user.
function read_activation_link {
    read -rp "Link: " link
    printf '%s\n' "$link"
}
