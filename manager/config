## Functions

# Run a command in the infra system, accepting additional ssh-options.
function ssh_target {
    ssh -i vm-key "$to" "$@"
}

# Install nre-files to the target system.
#
# * Extract all "signer-server" to modules/cassiopeia_signer/files in the target system.
# * Extract all "signer-client" to modules/cassiopeia_client/files in the target system.
# * Extract all "gigi" to modules/ner/files in the target system.

# Configure variables for puppet.
#
# The default implementation prompts the user for all required variables.
function configure {
    ssh_target -t 'bash conf-puppet --force'

# The default implementation asks the user to do so.

# Execute the gigi bootstrapping process. By default the process interacts with the user.
#
# This function can be overridden to execute "execute-bootstrap-user-auto" in order to automate this bootstrapping process.
# Make sure to provide "bootstrapper_details" to provide the necessary answers.
# To fully automate bootstrapping, you need to provide a way to extract the activation link (see "read_activation_link").
function execute-bootstrap-user {

}

# Obtain the activation link in the variable "$link".
#
# This is required for activating the first bootstrappers account.
# This is only required for automated bootstrap user.

    printf '%s\n' "$link"
}

# Assign to the variable "admin_email" the email address of the gigi user account that should issue certificates for the system.
function read_admin_email {

# Assign to the variable "admin_password" the password of the gigi user account that should issue certificates for the system.
function read_admin_password {

}

# Connect to gigi using $1 as local url part, the remaining args as additional curl arguments, "root.crt" as root certificate, "$folder/cookie-jar" as cookie-jar.
